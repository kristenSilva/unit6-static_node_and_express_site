Static Node.js and Express Site

A portfolio site to showcase projects. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page to share contact info, practice your elevator pitch and talk a little about yourself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least your first five projects from the Treehouse Techdegree.

Pug is used to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

1. Import the required dependencies
2. Link the JSON with the Pug templates
3. Set up routes to handle requests
4. Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
5. Handle errors
